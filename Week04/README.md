# Week04 Project
For problem1 to problem3, run each python file directly to get the results and graphs. The graphs will be saved into the directory "plots" in "Week04". problem3.py will need to import functions in problem2.py, so when you run problem3.py, make sure problem2.py is also in your directory.
Note: You should have the imported packages downloaded. And you should have the two csv file of data in your directory.
