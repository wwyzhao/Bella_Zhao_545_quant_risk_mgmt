# Week05 Project

For problem1 to problem3, run each python file directly to get the results and graphs. The graphs will be saved into the directory "plots" in "Week05". problem1.py, problem2.py, problem3.py will need to import functions in RiskMgmt directory, so when you run them, make sure RiskMgmt is also in your main directory.

Note: You should have the imported packages downloaded. And you should have the csv files of data in your directory.
